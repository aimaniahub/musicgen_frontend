MusicGen Frontend 🎵
This project is a user-friendly frontend interface for a music generation model. It allows users to input a text prompt, select a model, and generate a unique piece of music. The interface is built using modern web technologies to provide a seamless and responsive experience.

The application is designed to communicate with a backend service that runs the actual music generation AI model.

✨ Features
Interactive UI: A simple and clean interface built with React for a dynamic user experience.

Text-to-Music: Users can enter a descriptive prompt (e.g., "an 80s driving pop song with heavy drums and synth") to guide the music generation.

Model Selection: A dropdown menu to choose from different available music generation models.

Audio Playback: An integrated audio player to listen to the generated music directly in the browser.

Loading Indicator: Provides visual feedback to the user while the music is being generated.

🚀 Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3

HTTP Client: Axios (for making API requests to the backend)

Package Manager: npm

⚙️ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from nodejs.org.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/aimaniahub/musicgen_frontend.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd musicgen_frontend
Install NPM packages:

Bash

npm install
Configure the Backend API:
Open the src/App.js file and locate the handleSubmit function. You will need to replace the placeholder API endpoint with the actual URL of your music generation backend.

JavaScript

// Inside src/App.js
const response = await axios.post('http://YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL/generate', {
  // ... request body
});
Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can start the React development server:

Bash

npm start
This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.
